# Python-Terminal-Game
My 1st GitHub repo and 1st learning project outside the Codecademy workspaces.

The game is a console based TIC TAC TOE.

I started this project to learn by building, not to impress with complexity. Every part has been planned with pseudocode before any coding was done.

The purpose of this project is to practice:
    -Program structure
    -Pseudocode --> implementation
    -Input validation
    -Game state management
    -Functions and control flow

Not intended as a production-grade game, but as a clear demonstration of core programming concepts.

Features:
    -Two-players
    -Random starting player
    -3x3 grid with labeled rows and columns (A-C, 1-3)
    -Input validation (rejects invalid or occupied moves)
    -Win and tie detection
    -Replay option
    -Winner begins the next game

Concepts practiced:
    -Breaking a problem into smaller functions
    -Game loops and state tracking
    -Mapping user input to data structures
    -Defensive input handling
    -Clean, readable logic over optimization

What I have learnt:
